# Intro-to-HTML-CSS
These are the basics of web development.

# HTML Introduction
HTML is a standard markup language for creating web pages.
HTML describes the structure of the web page
HTML consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content.
HTML elements labels pieces of elements such as "Headings", "paragraphs", "Links" etc.

# Text Formatting
HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, to mark different elements.
HTML tags come in two types: opening tags and closing tags. e.g the opening tag for a paragraph is <p> , and the closing tag is </p>
These tags work together to define elements, which are like packages containing content. some elements, like paragraph contain require both opening and closing tags
while others do not
The HTML document is basically a bunch of HTML elements nested inside each other.
The browser pays attention to this structure and builds a big family tree that shows how everything is related. it is called a Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
It is important to pay attention to where we open and close our HTML tags and how we nest elements within each other. this helps convey meaning about the content and interfaces

# HTML Headlines
Web pages usually contains headlines, headings, subheading when dealing with lengthy text, these elements serve the purpose of dividing the content to smaller digestable chunks.
The HTML elements used for marking up headlines come in 6 different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. when view in a browser, each headline has a distinct visual effect.
These elements convey a sense of hierarchy in how the browser interprets and communicates about the page.
The h1 is the largest and most prominent, while the h6 is the smallest and least attention grabbing. The other elements fall somewhere in between in terms of prominance and importance.
The choice of the headline level is not based on appearance but on its meaning. It makes sense to use h1 for the main title and h2 for the subheading after the title.
The hierarchical system of the headlines gives meaning browser, distinguishing what is most important to what is less important, It also ensures that all article headlines share the same type, h2,
which is crucial for screen reader users who rely on consistent hierarchical information to navigate the page.

# HTML Bold and Italics
There are 4 elements in HTML that allow us to mark text as bold or italicized. Two of them "<em>" and "<strong>", convey meaning  and serve a language-related purpose. The other two, "<i>" and "<b>" do not
carry any specific meaning and are solely for visual styling
